# PyBOARD_RNG

![pic](https://github.com/MicroControleurMonde/PyBOARD_RNG/blob/main/Reports/MicroPython.jpg)

**Abstract:** Micro-python implementation of the **`pyb.rng()`** function to generate random numbers. 

The function specifically calls the hardcoded RNG in the chip directly (*as for the ESP32*)

## Generator coding:

Here is a typical example of use :

    import pyb
    random_number = pyb.rng()  # Returns a 32-bit random number
    print(random_number)
    
    Output: 112922794
I made a very basic code that makes 200'000 calls to the 'pyb.rng()' function. Here: [pyboard_rng.py](https://github.com/MicroControleurMonde/PyBOARD_RNG/blob/main/pyboard_rng.py)

The output file is a csv (200000_RNG.csv)

### Note:
Unlike the ESP32 board, I did not rewrite the RNG module which is perfectly functional natively for the Pyboard board in micropython.

The goal here is more to test the performance and RNG capabilities of the MCU than to code anything.

## Performance:

- Time spent to generate 200'000 values: 108 seconds (avg)
- Throughput: 7,407Â bytes/sec
- 1847 random values / sec.
