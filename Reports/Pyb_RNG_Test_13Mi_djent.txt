 opening 13_340_000_RNG.bin as binary
 Symbol Size(bits) = 1
   Min Entropy (by max occurrence of symbol 0) = 0.912487
   Analysing 426880136 1-bit symbols
   Shannon IID Entropy = 0.997177 bits per symbol
   Optimal compression would compress by 0.282292 percent
   Chi square: symbol count=426880137, distribution=1669459.66, randomly exceeds 0.00 percent of the time
   Mean = 0.468732
   Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.552569 (error 13.08 percent).
   Serial Correlation = 0.027452
   Longest Run Symbol = 0. Run Length = 31
   Probabilty of longest run being <= 31 = 0.905389
   Position of Longest Run = 7597082 (0x73ec1a). Byte position 949635 (0xe7d83)
   A 2 state Markov generator with transition probabilities P01=0.455864, P10=0.516684 would generate data with 
   the same mean and serial correlation
